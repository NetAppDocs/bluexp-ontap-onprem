.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, enter them in the Support Dashboard. After you have added the account, the clusters that are included in that account are displayed.
+
The Software Contract and Hardware Contract expiration dates appear on the line for each cluster.
