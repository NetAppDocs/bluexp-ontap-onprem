summary: If you need to perform advanced management of an ONTAP on-premises cluster, you can do so using ONTAP System Manager, which is a management interface that's provided with an ONTAP system. We have included the System Manager interface directly inside BlueXP so that you don't need to leave BlueXP for advanced management.

[.lead]
If you discovered an on-prem ONTAP cluster using a Connector, you can create volumes from the Standard view, use System Manager from the Advanced view, and enable BlueXP data services.

== Create volumes from the Standard view

After you discover your on-prem ONTAP cluster from BlueXP using a Connector, you can open the working environment to provision and manage storage.

=== Create volumes

BlueXP enables you to create NFS or CIFS volumes on existing aggregates. You can't create new aggregates on an on-prem ONTAP cluster from the BlueXP Standard view. You need to use the Advanced view to create aggregates.

A BlueXP feature called "templates" enables you to create volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for certain applications; such as databases or streaming services. If your organization has created volume templates that you should use, follow <<Create volumes from templates,these steps>>.

.Steps

. From the navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, double-click the name of the on-prem ONTAP cluster on which you want to provision volumes.

. Click *Volumes > Add Volume*.

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the volume.

.. *Details, Protection, & Tags*: Enter details about the volume like its name and size, choose a Snapshot policy, and specify volume tags, if desired.
+
Some of the fields on this page are self-explanatory. The following list describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="2,6"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Size | The maximum size that you can enter largely depends on whether you enable thin provisioning, which enables you to create a volume that is bigger than the physical storage currently available to it.

| Snapshot Policy | A Snapshot copy policy specifies the frequency and number of automatically created NetApp Snapshot copies. A NetApp Snapshot copy is a point-in-time file system image that has no performance impact and requires minimal storage. You can choose the default policy or none. You might choose none for transient data: for example, tempdb for Microsoft SQL Server.

|===

.. *Protocol*: Choose the protocol for the volume (NFS, CIFS, or iSCSI) and then set the access control or permissions for the volume.
+
If you choose CIFS and a server isn't set up yet, then BlueXP prompts you to set up a CIFS server using either Active Directory or a workgroup.
+
The following list describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="2,6"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Access Control | An NFS export policy defines the clients in the subnet that can access the volume. By default, BlueXP enters a value that provides access to all instances in the subnet.

| Permissions and Users/Groups | These fields enable you to control the level of access to an SMB share for users and groups (also called access control lists or ACLs). You can specify local or domain Windows users or groups, or UNIX users or groups. If you specify a domain Windows user name, you must include the user's domain using the format domain\username.

|===

.. *Usage Profile*: Choose whether to enable or disable storage efficiency features on the volume in order to reduce the total amount of storage that you need.

.. *Review*: Review details about the volume and then click *Add*.

=== Create volumes from templates

If your organization has created on-premises ONTAP volume templates so you can deploy volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for certain applications, follow the steps in this section.

The template should make your job easier because certain volume parameters will already be defined in the template, such as disk type, size, protocol, snapshot policy, and more. When a parameter is already predefined, you can just skip to the next volume parameter.

NOTE: You can only create NFS or CIFS volumes when using templates.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, click the name of the on-premises ONTAP system on which you want to provision a volume.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[An icon with three dots.] > *Add Volume From Template*.
+
image:screenshot_template_add_vol_ontap.png[A screenshot showing how to add a new volume from a template.]

. In the _Select Template_ page, select the template that you want to use to create the volume and click *Next*.
+
image:screenshot_select_template_ontap.png[A screenshot of the available application templates.]
+
The _Define Parameters_ page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_define_ontap_vol_from_template.png[A screenshot showing a blank template that you need to fill in to create a volume.]
+
*Note:* You can click the checkbox *Show read-only parameters* to show all the fields that have been locked by the template if you want to see the values for those parameters. By default these predefined fields are hidden and only the fields you need to complete are shown.

. In the _Context_ area, the Working Environment is filled in with the name of the working environment you started with. You need to select the *Storage VM* and *Aggregate* where the volume will be created.

. Add values for all of the parameters that are not hard-coded from the template. 
+
<<Create volumes,Learn about the parameters that you need to create the volume>>.

. Click *Run Template* after you have defined all the parameters needed for this volume.

.Result

BlueXP provisions the volume and displays a page so that you can see the progress.

image:screenshot_template_creating_resource_ontap.png[A screenshot showing the progress of creating your new volume from the template.]

Then the new volume is added to the working environment.

Additionally, if any secondary action is implemented in the template, for example, enabling Cloud Backup on the volume, that action is also performed.

.After you finish

If you provisioned a CIFS share, give users or groups permissions to the files and folders and verify that those users can access the share and create a file.

== Administer ONTAP using the Advanced View

If you need to perform advanced management of an on-premises ONTAP cluster, you can do so using ONTAP System Manager, which is a management interface that's provided with an ONTAP system. We have included the System Manager interface directly inside BlueXP so that you don't need to leave BlueXP for advanced management.

This Advanced View is available as a Preview. We plan to refine this experience and add enhancements in upcoming releases. Please send us feedback by using the in-product chat.

=== Features

The Advanced View in BlueXP gives you access to additional management features:

* Advanced storage management
+
Manage consistency groups, shares, qtrees, quotas, and Storage VMs.

* Networking management
+
Manage IPspaces, network interfaces, portsets, and ethernet ports.

* Events and jobs
+
View event logs, system alerts, jobs, and audit logs.

* Advanced data protection
+
Protect storage VMs, LUNs, and consistency groups.

* Host management
+
Set up SAN initiator groups and NFS clients.

=== Supported configurations

Advanced management through System Manager is supported with on-premises ONTAP clusters running 9.10.0 or later.

System Manager integration is not supported in GovCloud regions or in regions that have no outbound internet access.

=== Limitations

A few System Manager features are not supported with on-premises ONTAP clusters when using the Advanced View in BlueXP.

== Enable BlueXP data services

Enable BlueXP data services on your working environments to replicate, back up, scan, and tier data.

=== Replicate data

You can replicate data between Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems and ONTAP clusters by choosing a one-time data replication, which can help you move data to and from the cloud, or a recurring schedule, which can help with disaster recovery or long-term retention.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-replication/task-replicating-data.html[Learn how to replicate data^]

=== Back up data

You can back up data from your on-premises ONTAP system to low-cost object storage in the cloud by using Cloud Backup. This service provides backup and restore capabilities for protection and long-term archive of your on-prem and cloud data.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-backup-restore/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[Learn how to back up data to the cloud^]

=== Scan, map, and classify your data

Cloud Data Sense can scan your corporate on-premises clusters to map and classify data, and to identify private information. This can help reduce your security and compliance risk, decrease storage costs, and assist with your data migration projects.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-data-sense/concept-cloud-compliance.html[Learn how to scan, map, and classify your data^]

=== Tier data to the cloud

Extend your data center to the cloud by automatically tiering inactive data from ONTAP clusters to object storage using Cloud Tiering.
