If you discovered an on-premises ONTAP cluster using a Connector, you can create volumes from the Standard view, use System Manager from the Advanced view, and enable BlueXP data services.

On the Canvas, the working environment icon for a cluster that you discovered with a Connector should look similar to the following:

If a working environment was discovered directly, the working environment icon includes the word "Direct."

== Create FlexVol volumes from the Standard view

After you discover your on-prem ONTAP cluster from BlueXP using a Connector, you can open the working environment to provision and manage FlexVol volumes.

=== Create volumes

BlueXP enables you to create NFS or CIFS volumes on existing aggregates. You can't create new aggregates on an on-prem ONTAP cluster from the BlueXP Standard view. You need to use the Advanced view to create aggregates.

.Steps

. From the navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, select the on-prem ONTAP cluster on which you want to provision volumes.

. Select *Volumes > Add Volume*.

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the volume.

.. *Details, Protection, & Tags*: Enter details about the volume like its name and size and choose a Snapshot policy.
+
Some of the fields on this page are self-explanatory. The following list describes fields for which you might need guidance:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="2,6"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Size | The maximum size that you can enter largely depends on whether you enable thin provisioning, which enables you to create a volume that is bigger than the physical storage currently available to it.

| Snapshot Policy | A Snapshot copy policy specifies the frequency and number of automatically created NetApp Snapshot copies. A NetApp Snapshot copy is a point-in-time file system image that has no performance impact and requires minimal storage. You can choose the default policy or none. You might choose none for transient data: for example, tempdb for Microsoft SQL Server.

|===

.. *Protocol*: Choose the protocol for the volume (NFS, CIFS, or iSCSI) and then set the access control or permissions for the volume.
+
If you choose CIFS and a server isn't set up yet, then BlueXP prompts you to set up a CIFS server using either Active Directory or a workgroup.

+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="2,6"]
|===
| Field
| Description

| Access Control | An NFS export policy defines the clients in the subnet that can access the volume. By default, BlueXP enters a value that provides access to all instances in the subnet.

| Permissions and Users/Groups | These fields enable you to control the level of access to an SMB share for users and groups (also called access control lists or ACLs). You can specify local or domain Windows users or groups, or UNIX users or groups. If you specify a domain Windows user name, you must include the user's domain using the format domain\username.

|===

.. *Usage Profile*: Choose whether to enable or disable storage efficiency features on the volume in order to reduce the total amount of storage that you need.

.. *Review*: Review details about the volume and then select *Add*.

== Create FlexGroup volumes

You can use the BlueXP API to create FlexGroup volumes. A FlexGroup volume is a scale-out volume that provides high performance along with automatic load distribution.

== Administer ONTAP using the Advanced View (System Manager)

If you need to perform advanced management of an on-premises ONTAP cluster, you can do so using ONTAP System Manager, which is a management interface that's provided with an ONTAP system. We have included the System Manager interface directly inside BlueXP so that you don't need to leave BlueXP for advanced management.

This Advanced View is available as a Preview. We plan to refine this experience and add enhancements in upcoming releases. Please send us feedback by using the in-product chat.

=== Features

The Advanced View in BlueXP gives you access to additional management features:

* Advanced storage management
+
Manage consistency groups, shares, qtrees, quotas, and Storage VMs.

* Networking management
+
Manage IPspaces, network interfaces, portsets, and ethernet ports.

* Events and jobs
+
View event logs, system alerts, jobs, and audit logs.

* Advanced data protection
+
Protect storage VMs, LUNs, and consistency groups.

* Host management
+
Set up SAN initiator groups and NFS clients.

=== Supported configurations

Advanced management through System Manager is supported with on-premises ONTAP clusters running 9.10.0 or later.

System Manager integration is not supported in GovCloud regions or in regions that have no outbound internet access.

=== Limitations

A few System Manager features are not supported with on-premises ONTAP clusters when using the Advanced View in BlueXP. 

link:reference-limitations.html[Review the list of limitations].

=== Use the Advanced View

Open an on-premises ONTAP working environment and select the Advanced View option.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, select the on-prem ONTAP cluster on which you want to provision volumes.

. From the right panel, under *Services*, find *System Manager* and select *Open*.
+

. If the confirmation message appears, read through it and select *Close*.

. Use System Manager to manage ONTAP.

. If needed, select *Switch to Standard View* to return to standard management through BlueXP.

== Enable BlueXP services

Enable BlueXP data services on your working environments to replicate data, back up data, tier data, and more.

Replicate data::
Replicate data between Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, Amazon FSx for ONTAP file systems, and ONTAP clusters. Choose a one-time data replication, which can help you move data to and from the cloud, or a recurring schedule, which can help with disaster recovery or long-term data retention.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-replication/task-replicating-data.html[Replication documentation^]

Back up data::
Back up data from your on-premises ONTAP system to low-cost object storage in the cloud.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-backup-recovery/concept-backup-to-cloud.html[Backup and recovery documentation^]

Scan, map, and classify your data::
Scan your corporate on-premises clusters to map and classify data, and to identify private information. This can help reduce your security and compliance risk, decrease storage costs, and assist with your data migration projects.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/concept-cloud-compliance.html[Classification documentation^]

Tier data to the cloud::
Extend your data center to the cloud by automatically tiering inactive data from ONTAP clusters to object storage.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-tiering/concept-cloud-tiering.html[Tiering documentation^]

Maintain health, uptime, and performance::
Implement suggested remediations to ONTAP clusters before an outage or failure occurs.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-operational-resiliency/index.html[Operational resiliency documentation^]

Identify clusters with low capacity::
Identify clusters that are showing low capacity, review clusters for current and forecasted capacity, and more.
