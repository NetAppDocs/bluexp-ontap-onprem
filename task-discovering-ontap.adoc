summary: BlueXP can discover the ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, in a NetApp Private Storage configuration, and in the IBM Cloud. Adding on-prem clusters to the BlueXP Canvas enables you to manage these clusters using the same tools as your Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other cloud storage solutions.

Discover on-prem ONTAP clusters from BlueXP so that you can start managing volumes and performing advanced management using ONTAP System Manager, which is available from BlueXP so that you don't need to leave BlueXP for advanced management.

== Discovery and management options

BlueXP provides two ways to discover and manage your on-prem ONTAP clusters:

Discovery through a Connector:: 
This option enables you to manage the cluster using the following features:

* The Standard view, which provides basic volume operations
* The Advanced view, which provides management through System Manager
* Integration with BlueXP data services, which provide data replication, backup and recovery, data classification, and data tiering

+
A Connector must be installed in a cloud provider or on your premises.

Direct discovery::
This option enables you to manage the cluster using System Manager. No other management options are available.
+
This option doesn't require a Connector.

Once discovered, your clusters are available as a working environment on the BlueXP Canvas.

== Discover clusters using a Connector

Discover your on-prem ONTAP clusters with a Connector to take advantage of all management capabilities that BlueXP has to offer.

.Requirements

* You should have gotten started with BlueXP, which includes logging in and setting up an account.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-overview.html[Learn how to get started with BlueXP^]

* A Connector must be installed in a cloud provider or on your premises.
+
If you want to tier cold data to the cloud, then you should review requirements for the Connector based on where you plan to tier cold data.

** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html[Switching between Connectors^]
** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-tiering/concept-cloud-tiering.html[Learn about Cloud Tiering^]

* You need the cluster management IP address and the password for the admin user account to add the cluster to BlueXP.
+
BlueXP discovers ONTAP clusters using HTTPS. If you use custom firewall policies, they must meet the following requirements:

** The Connector host must allow outbound HTTPS access through port 443.
+
If the Connector is in the cloud, all outbound communication is allowed by the predefined security group.

** The ONTAP cluster must allow inbound HTTPS access through port 443.
+
The default "mgmt" firewall policy allows inbound HTTPS access from all IP addresses. If you modified this default policy, or if you created your own firewall policy, you must associate the HTTPS protocol with that policy and enable access from the Connector host.

.Steps

. From the navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, click *Add Working Environment* and select *On-Premises*.

. Select *On-Premises ONTAP*.

. If you're prompted, create a Connector.
+
Refer to the requirements above for more details.

. On the _ONTAP Cluster Details_ page, enter the cluster management IP address, the password for the admin user account, and click *Add*.
+

. On the _Details & Credentials_ page, enter a name and description for the working environment, and then click *Go*.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the cluster and adds it to a working environment in the Canvas.

== Discover clusters directly

Directly discover your on-premises ONTAP clusters from BlueXP in order to manage the clusters using System Manager.

TIP: When you access System Manager on an on-premises ONTAP cluster running 9.12.1 or later with connectivity to the BlueXP service, you'll be prompted to manage the cluster directly from BlueXP. If you follow this prompt, it discovers the cluster in BlueXP just like described in this section.

.Requirements

* You should have gotten started with BlueXP, which includes logging in and setting up an account.
+

* The on-premises ONTAP cluster must be running 9.12.1 or later with connectivity to the BlueXP service.

* You need the cluster management IP address and the password for the admin user account.

BlueXP discovers ONTAP clusters using HTTPS. If you use custom firewall policies, the ONTAP cluster must allow inbound HTTPS access through port 443.

The default "mgmt" firewall policy allows inbound HTTPS access from all IP addresses. If you modified this default policy, or if you created your own firewall policy, you must associate the HTTPS protocol with that policy and enable access from the Connector host.

.Steps

. From the navigation menu, select *Storage > Canvas*.

. On the Canvas page, click *Add Working Environment* and select *On-Premises*.

. Select *Local On-Premises ONTAP (Direct)*.

. Enter the cluster management IP address, the password for the admin user account, and click *Add*.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the cluster and adds it to a working environment in the Canvas.
