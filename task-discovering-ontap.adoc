BlueXP can discover the ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, in a NetApp Private Storage configuration, and in the IBM Cloud. Adding on-prem clusters to the BlueXP Canvas enables you to manage these clusters using the same tools as your Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other cloud storage solutions.

In addition to being able to provision storage on those systems, adding these systems to BlueXP also makes it easy to view hardware and software contract status information in the Digital Wallet, and configure critical cloud-based services for those clusters. This includes replicating data to the cloud, backing up data to the cloud, tiering cold data to the cloud, and running compliance scans on that data.

== Requirements

* A Connector installed in a cloud provider or on your premises.
+
If you want to tier cold data to the cloud, then you should review requirements for the Connector based on where you plan to tier cold data.
+

** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-managing-connectors.html[Switching between Connectors^]
** https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-tiering/concept-cloud-tiering.html[Learn about Cloud Tiering^]

* The cluster management IP address and the password for the admin user account to add the cluster to BlueXP.
+
BlueXP discovers ONTAP clusters using HTTPS. If you use custom firewall policies, they must meet the following requirements:

** The Connector host must allow outbound HTTPS access through port 443.
+
If the Connector is in the cloud, all outbound communication is allowed by the predefined security group.

** The ONTAP cluster must allow inbound HTTPS access through port 443.
+
The default "mgmt" firewall policy allows inbound HTTPS access from all IP addresses. If you modified this default policy, or if you created your own firewall policy, you must associate the HTTPS protocol with that policy and enable access from the Connector host.

* A valid set of NetApp Support Site credentials. See how to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/task-adding-nss-accounts.html[add the NSS account to BlueXP^].

== Viewing discovered and undiscovered on-prem clusters

You can use the _Digital Wallet_ service in BlueXP to view, discover, and manage your on-prem ONTAP clusters that are under a support contract.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. Click the *On-Premises ONTAP* tab.
+
image:screenshot_digital_wallet_onprem_main.png[A screenshot of the Digital Wallet page for on-premises ONTAP clusters.]
+
Your ONTAP clusters are displayed with a status of whether they have been discovered in BlueXP.
+
If you are prompted to enter your NetApp Support Site (NSS) account credentials first, enter them in the Support Dashboard. After you have added the account, the clusters that are included in that account are displayed.

== Viewing cluster information and contract details

You can use the _Digital Wallet_ to view cluster details and hardware and software contract status.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. In the *Digital Wallet*, click the *On-Premises ONTAP* tab.
+
The Software Contract and Hardware Contract expiration dates appear on the line for each cluster.

. If the contract is close to the expiration date, or has expired, you can click the chat icon in the lower-right of BlueXP to request an extension to the contract.

. For clusters that you want to know additional details, click image:button_down_caret.png[A down-caret icon] to expand the cluster information.

== Discovering on-prem clusters from BlueXP

You can discover on-prem ONTAP clusters in BlueXP from the _Digital Wallet_ or from the _Canvas_. Once discovered, they are available as a working environment in BlueXP so that you can manage the cluster.

=== Discovering clusters from the Digital Wallet

You can discover your ONTAP clusters from the Digital Wallet and add them as a working environment.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP navigation menu, select *Governance > Digital wallet*.

. From the *Digital Wallet*, click the *On-Premises ONTAP* tab.
+
image:screenshot_digital_wallet_clusters.png[A screenshot of the On-Premises ONTAP page showing all clusters found in your NSS account.]

. Click *Discover* for the cluster that you want to manage through BlueXP.

. On the _Discover ONTAP Cluster_ page, enter the password for the admin user account and click *Discover*.
+
image:screenshot_discover_ontap_wallet.png[A screenshot that shows an example of the ONTAP Cluster Details page: the cluster management IP address, user name and password.]
+
Note that the cluster management IP address is populated based on information from the Digital Wallet.
+
The status for the cluster turns to *Discovered* in the _On-Premises ONTAP_ page.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the cluster and adds it to a working environment in the Canvas using the cluster name as the working environment name.

You can enable services for this cluster in the right panel to replicate data to and from the cluster, set up data tiering to the cloud, back up volumes to the cloud, or run compliance scans on the volumes. You can also create new volumes or launch System Manager to perform advanced tasks.

=== Discovering clusters from the Canvas page

You can discover your ONTAP clusters and add them as a working environment from the Canvas page. These steps can be used in cases where the cluster is not listed in the Digital Wallet because it currently has no support contract.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, click *Add Working Environment* and select *On-Premises ONTAP*.

. If you're prompted, create a Connector.
+
Refer to the links above for more details.

. On the _ONTAP Cluster Details_ page, enter the cluster management IP address, the password for the admin user account, and click *Add*.
+

. On the _Details & Credentials_ page, enter a name and description for the working environment, and then click *Go*.

.Result

BlueXP discovers the cluster and adds it to a working environment in the Canvas.

You can enable services for this cluster in the right panel to replicate data to and from the cluster, set up data tiering to the cloud, back up volumes to the cloud, or run compliance scans on the volumes. You can also create new volumes or launch System Manager to perform advanced tasks.
