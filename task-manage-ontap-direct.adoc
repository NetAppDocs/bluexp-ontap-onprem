If you discovered your on-prem ONTAP cluster directly without using a Connector, you can open the working environment to manage the cluster by using ONTAP System Manager.

[NOTE]

.Before you begin

The computer that you're using to access the BlueXP console must have a network connection to the on-prem ONTAP cluster, similar to how you would provide connections to other resources in your private network.



.Limitations

A few System Manager features are not supported from BlueXP.

.Steps

. On the Canvas page, select the on-premises ONTAP working environment.

The working environment icon identifies clusters that were discovered directly:

. If prompted, enter your ONTAP credentials.
+
You're prompted to log in with your ONTAP credentials each time that you open the working environment, if you don't save the credentials. You have the option to save the credentials so that you don't need to enter them each time. You can manage these credentials on the User Credentials page. In some cases, your BlueXP administrator (Org admin role) may have disabled this option and require you to enter your credentials each time.
