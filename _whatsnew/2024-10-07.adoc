=== Support for ASA r2 systems
You can now discover NetApp ASA r2 systems in BlueXP. After you discover a NetApp ASA r2 system and open the working environment, you're brought directly to System Manager.

No other management options are available with ASA r2 systems. You can't use the Standard view and you can't enable BlueXP services.
