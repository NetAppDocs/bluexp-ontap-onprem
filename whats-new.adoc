=== An "On-Premises ONTAP" tab is available in the Digital Wallet.

Now you can view an inventory of your on-prem ONTAP clusters along with their hardware and service contracts expiration dates. Additional details about the clusters are also available.

link:task-discovering-ontap.html#viewing-cluster-information-and-contract-details[See how to view this important on-prem cluster information]. You'll need to have a NetApp Support Site account (NSS) for the clusters, and the NSS credentials will need to be attached to your Cloud Manager account.

== 11 Jan 2022

=== Tags that you add to volumes on on-prem ONTAP clusters can be use with the Tagging service.

Tags that you add to a volume are now associated with the  tagging feature of the Application Templates service, which can help you organize and simplify the management of your resources.

=== On-prem ONTAP cluster information available in the Active IQ service

* When Active IQ displays the list of your on-prem clusters (based on your NSS account), you can click a button to link:task-discovering-ontap.html#discovering-clusters-from-the-discovery-page[discover the cluster^] and add it to the Cloud Manager Canvas. This makes it easier to manage all your storage systems from Cloud Manager.

* When Active IQ determines that one or more clusters require firmware updates, you can click a button to link:task-managing-ontap.html#downloading-new-disk-and-shelf-firmware[download the Ansible playbook and upgrade the cluster firmware^].

* A new link:task-managing-ontap.html#viewing-on-prem-workloads-that-are-candidates-for-the-cloud[Cloud-Ready Workloads tab^] provides a list of the workloads or volumes that we have identified as ideal to move to the cloud from your on-prem ONTAP clusters. Moving some of these volumes could reduce your costs and improve performance and resiliency.
